# 7.6 Product Lists (Annex III & IV)

## 7.6.1 Overview

The Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) defines specific product categories in **Annex III** and **Annex IV** that are subject to special conformity assessment procedures. This page contains the complete lists of all product categories specified therein, including descriptions, required assessment procedures, and a relevance assessment for BAUER GROUP.

The classification logic (decision tree, assessment procedure per category) is described on the [Product Classification](/en/conformity/product-classification) page.

::: info LEGAL BASIS
**Art. 7 CRA** defines the categories "Important products with digital elements" (Annex III) and "Critical products with digital elements" (Annex IV).

**Art. 24(1)-(3) CRA** establishes the conformity assessment procedures per category:

- **Class I (Annex III Part I):** Internal control (Module A) where harmonised standards are applied, otherwise EU type examination (Module B+C)
- **Class II (Annex III Part II):** EU type examination (Module B+C) or Comprehensive quality assurance (Module H)
- **Critical (Annex IV):** European cybersecurity certificate (EUCC) at assurance level "substantial" or higher

**Art. 7(3) CRA** empowers the Commission to adopt delegated acts amending Annexes III and IV.
