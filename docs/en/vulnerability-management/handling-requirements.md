# Vulnerability Handling Requirements (Annex I Part II)

## Overview

Annex I Part II of the CRA defines 8 vulnerability handling requirements that manufacturers must fulfill throughout the entire support period of a product with digital elements. While Part I governs the security properties of the product itself ([Essential Security Requirements](/en/technical-documentation/security-requirements)), Part II addresses the organizational and procedural obligations for handling vulnerabilities.

::: info LEGAL BASIS
**Annex I Part II CRA:** Vulnerability handling requirements. Manufacturers of products with digital elements shall comply with the following requirements in order to effectively handle vulnerabilities of the product throughout the support period.
